#### Use

The .NIB files are conversions of the original TK2000 DSKs. DSK and CT2 support is a WIP.

Use the OSD to open the options menu. To load a program, select the option "LOAD *.NIB" in the menu and wait for the TK2000 to boot. Sometimes its necessary to go back to the OSD menu, and select the "RESET" option after loading a NIB file.
